Here are three papers on stellar structure. The "Gran Tarea 1" code implements stellar astrophysics calculations in two parts using numerical integration and differential equation analysis in hydrostatic equilibrium. Part 1 shows how to calculate the Sun's gravitational potential energy and its relationship to an approximate bound. Part 2 explores the contribution of radiation pressure to massive stars as a function of their chemical composition.
The "Gran Tarea 2" code solves the Lane-Emden equation, which describes the equilibrium of polytropic stars, using the Runge-Kutta method of order 4 (RK4).
The "Gran Tarea 3" code is implemented to analyze the internal structure of stars in different mass ranges and construct the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars in the Main Sequence (ZAMS).
